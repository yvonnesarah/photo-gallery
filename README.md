## ðŸ“Œ Description
The Photo Gallery Web App is an intuitive and dynamic application that allows users to explore and manage a collection of random photos. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it integrates with the Unsplash API to fetch random photos based on user input. Users can specify the number of photos to display (between 0 and 11) and the gallery will adjust accordingly.

The gallery is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience across devices, from desktop to mobile. On larger screens, three images are displayed per row; two on tablets; and one on mobile. Flexbox is used for responsive layout, making the images adapt efficiently to screen sizes.

The app also incorporates error handling, allowing users to experience smooth functionality even when issues arise.
